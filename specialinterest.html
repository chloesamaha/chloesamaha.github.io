    <h2> Much of what Chloe does stems from the fact that she is a learn-aholic and an adrenaline seeker.
She hopes to harness all of her interests and integrate them in her day-to-day life. A big part of Chloe is her multicultural background. As a French, American, and Lebanese, Chloe has learned to understand and interpret language through different lenses. This piece has always pushed her to look at the world and approach problems with a multifaceted lens. One of the ways she has implemented this in her life is through music. Music has always been a massive part of her life, as she grew up in a very musical family. Her favorite instrument is the guitar; however, she also plays the drums, piano, and ukulele.
In fact, Chloe is usually attracted to hobbies that get her out in nature and allow her to spend her energy. Her favorite hobbies are skydiving, skiing, sailing, tennis, camping, and traveling. Chloe's first bucket-list item is to travel and explore every country through the lens of a local.
Her north star is to build a life and live every day surrounded by people she loves, working on something she loves in places she loves.
If you meet Chloe, you will notice that she tackles life with a smile.
Her hope is to one day leave a legacy of having been a source of happiness and GOOD TROUBLE :) </h2>
